# nba_winprob
This repository contains all the files that were used in creating a single-game win probability model for the NBA. All data was scraped from basketball-reference.com using the BeautifulSoup library in Python. The results of the model were presented in an R Shiny application, which can be opened through the wp.Rmd file.
